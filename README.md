# VDCount
A model for automated counting of dead/fallen Varroa Destructor (a dangerous honeybee parasite) females from photos. This is an experimental work in progress
and so far only standard Langstroth hives' varroa-monitoring pads are supported. I will add support for other dimensions of 
hives soon. If you can build an Android and/or iPhone app and are interested in working on this project, please contact me.
